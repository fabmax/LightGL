LightGL
=======

A very light-weight pure-Java Android OpenGL framework.

The main purpose of this is for me to learn OpenGL ES2.0, but I aim for a graphics engine that is actually usable.
However there's a long way to go. Currently only basic triangle meshes and custom shaders are supported. Included are
two shaders: a very basic color shader and a slightly more advanced Phong shader supporting per-pixel lighting.

The included demo Activity shows a spinning color cube illuminated by a single light source.
