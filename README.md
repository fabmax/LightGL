LightGL
=======

A very light-weight pure-Java Android OpenGL framework.

The main purpose of this is for me to learn OpenGL ES 2.0, but I aim for a graphics engine that is actually usable.
However there's a long way to go.

Features:
* Arbitrary triangle meshes with texture mapping or vertex colors
* Simple scene graph supporting arbitrary object transformations
* Custom shaders for Phong lighting, next will be shadow mapping
* Model loading for .obj files

The included demo Activity shows a simple scene illuminated by a single light source.
